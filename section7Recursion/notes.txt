RECURSION

Objectives:
- Define what recursion is and how it can be used
- Understand the two essential components of a recursive function
- Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
- Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

What is recursion?
- A process (a function in our case) that calls itself

Why use recursion?
- It's everywhere!
- JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
- Object traversal
- Very common with more complex algorithms
- It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

The Call Stack
- It's a stack data structure
- Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
- When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)

Why do I care?
- You're used to functions being pushed on the call stack and popped off when they are done
- When we write recursive functions, we keep pushing new functions onto the call stack!

How recursive functions work
- Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case!
- Two essential parts of a recursive function!
    - Base Case
        - The condition when the recursion ends. This is the most important concept to understand
    - Different Input
        - The input that changes every time the function is called recursively

Where things go wrong
- No base case 
    - or base case is wrong
    - Results in infinite loop!/ Call Stack overflow! (Maximum call stack size exceeded)
- Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
    - Results in Call Stack overflow!

Helper Method Recursion
- Outer function is not recursive but calls an inner function which is recursive
- Helper method recursion is a pattern
- Useful when we need to collect data or when we need to do something in between recursive calls

Pure Recursion Tips
- For arrays, use methods like slice, the spread operator, and concat that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
- Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
- To make copies of objects use Object.assign, or the spread operator

Helper Method Recursion vs Pure Recursion
- Pure recursion is cleaner but can be more difficult to understand
- Helper method recursion is easier to understand but we have the overhead of that extra function call
