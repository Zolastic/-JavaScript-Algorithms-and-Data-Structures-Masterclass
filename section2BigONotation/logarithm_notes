The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you have to halve it to get down to 1.

logarithmic time complexity - O(log n)
logarithmic time complexity is great because it scales well with large inputs.

Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithmic time complexity.

Recursive algorithms sometimes have logarithmic space complexity.
