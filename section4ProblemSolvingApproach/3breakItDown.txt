BREAK IT DOWN


Break It Down:
- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take. 
(This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax) as well.)
(Can write in terms of comments)


Example:
Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string. (Compare this to the example in section4ProblemSolvingApproach/2concreteExamplesNotes)
(Interviewer said we only need to care about lowercase letters and numbers. We can ignore spaces, special characters, and uppercase letters.)

Writing some comments:
function charCount(str) {
    // do something
    // return an object with keys that are lowercase alphanumeric characters in the string; values should be the counts for those characters
}

function charCount(str) {
    // make object to return at end
    // loop over string, for each character...
        // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
        // if the char is a number/letter AND is not in object, add it to object and set value to 1
        // if char is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
    // return object at end
}
