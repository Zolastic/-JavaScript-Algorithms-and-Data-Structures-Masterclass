UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM


Ask yourselves these questions when you encounter a problem:
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? (This is a good way to make sure you understand the problem)
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? (What are the inputs that the function accepts?)
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (What should the function return?)
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? (This is a good way to make sure you understand the problem)


Example:
Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.
1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- Implement addition

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- int? floats? what about string for large numbers?

3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
- int? float? string?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- Yes (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
- num1, num2, sum
