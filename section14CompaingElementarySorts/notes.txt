ELEMENTARY SORTING ALGORITHMS

Elementary Sorting Algorithms are also known as Quadratic Sorting Algorithms. 
The reason for this is that the time complexity of these algorithms is O(n^2).
This means that the time taken by these algorithms to sort an array of n elements is proportional to n^2.
Their space complexity is O(1) because they do not use any extra space.

The following are the elementary sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

These algorithms are not used in practice because of their poor performance.
Both Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort is good if the array is almost sorted.

Insertion Sort works very well if you need your data to be continuously sorted. 
So, if you have a stream of data coming in and you want to sort it, then you can use Insertion Sort.

Recap:
- Sorting is fundamental!
- Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
- All have average time complexity of O(n^2)
- We can do better... but we need more complex algorithms!
