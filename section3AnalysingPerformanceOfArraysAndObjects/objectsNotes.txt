When to use objects
- When you don't need order
- When you need fast access/insertion and removal

Big O of Objects
- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N) - searching for a value in an object is O(N) because you have to search through all the values to find it. Note this searching for a value.
- Access - O(1)

main takeaway between arrays and objects:
- objects are fast at insertion, removal, and accessing, but slow at searching. There is no order to objects.
- arrays are fast at access, but slow at insertion and removal (except at the end of the array). There is order to arrays.
