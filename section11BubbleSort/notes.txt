What is sorting?
- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order.
- Examples:
  - Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
  - Sorting names alphabetically
  - Sorting movies based on release year
  - Sorting movies based on revenue

Why learn sorting?
- Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
- There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages

Objectives
- Implement bubble sort
- Implement selection sort
- Implement insertion sort
- Understand why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms

JavaScript has a sort method
- Yes, it's built in!
- It's a very fast and efficient sorting method
- It converts each element to a string and sorts based on the UTF-16 code value
- You can use a compare function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort

Telling JavaScript how to sort
- The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
- You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort
- The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
  - If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
  - If it returns a positive number, a should come after b
  - If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned

Bubble Sort (https://visualgo.net/en/sorting?slide=1)
- A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!
- As you loop through each item it compares it to the next item in the array and swaps them if the next item is larger
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
