MERGE SORT

Merge Sorting
- It's a combination of two things - merging and sorting!
- Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
- Works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array

How does it work?
- In order to implement merge sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible for merging two sorted arrays
