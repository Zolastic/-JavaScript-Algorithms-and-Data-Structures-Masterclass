"Crazy Sorts" (Intermediate Sorting Algorithms)

Objectives
- Understand the limitations of elementary/ quadratic sorting algorithms
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

Why learn this?
- Elementary Sorting Algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100,000 elements... It will take a while!

Faster Sorts
- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
